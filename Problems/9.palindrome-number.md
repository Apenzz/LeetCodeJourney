# Problem
[https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

# Description
Given an integer _x_, return __true__ if _x_ is a palindrome, and __false__ otherwise.

# Solution
A palindrome integer is a number that reads the same forward and backward.
The simplest way to solve this in pyhton is to compare the string of _x_ with its reverse and return __true__ if they're equal and __false__ otherwise.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
```

# Complexity
If _n_ is the number of digits of _x_ then:

- time: O(n)

- space: O(n)
