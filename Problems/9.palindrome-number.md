# Problem
Given an integer _x_, return __true__ if _x_ is a palindrome, and __false__ otherwise.

# Solution
A palindrome integer is a number that reads the same forward and backward.
The simplest way to solve this in pyhton is to compare the string of _x_ with its reverse and return __true__ if they're equal and __false__ otherwise.
