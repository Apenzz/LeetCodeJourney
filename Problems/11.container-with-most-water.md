# Problem
[https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

# Description
You are given an integer array _height_ of length _n_. There are _n_ vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the _ith_ line are _(i, 0)_ and _(i, height[i])_.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

# Constraints

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104

# Solution
We use two pointer _left_ and _right_ starting from the leftmost and rightmost sides of the array respectively.
At each iteration we move one of them inward until _left_ >= _right_.
The max water contained at each step is given by the minimum height between height[left] and height[right] times the distance on the x-axis (right - left).
We use the _max_water_ variable to keep track of the maximum water container found until now.

For choosing which index to move at each step of the loop we have to think about the problem: every iteration the width of the container is always decreasing and the limiting factor for each given step is the column with smaller height such that moving the index of the greater column won't ever improve the max area. So at each step we move the index of the smaller column.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_water = 0

        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1

        while (left < right):
            water = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            max_water = max(max_water, water)
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return max_water
```
