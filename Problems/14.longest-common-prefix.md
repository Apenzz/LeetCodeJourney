[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

# Description
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

# Constraints

- 1 <= strs.length <= 200
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
- strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters


# Solution
The longest possible prefix can be as long as the shortest string in the array, so we first need to find the minimum length element _c_.
If the strings have the same prefix it means that up to a certain point (let's call it _x_) we have that the substring s\[0:x+1] is equal for each string in the array and the maximum possible length of this substring is _c_.
We can iteratre through the characters of the strings up to _c_ and for each iteration add the characters to the set _chs_.
If we are in the prefix substring the set will contain only one character and we add it to the answer.
Otherwise it means we are no longer in the prefix substring and we can exit.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        ans = ""
        c = min([len(s) for s in strs])
        

        for i in range(c):
            chs = set(s[i] for s in strs)
            if len(chs) == 1:
                ans += chs.pop()
            else:
                break
        return ans
```

# Complexity
if _n_ is the length of the array and _c_ is the length of the shortest string then:

- time: O(c*n)
- space: O(n)
