# Description
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

# Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'

# Solution
We use a stack to solve this problem: for every opening bracket we add it to the stack and each time we find a closing braket we pop the top of the stack and check if the popped value and the closing bracket are a valid <key,value> pair of the dictionary.
Lastly after iterating through the string we need to check if the stack is empty or not.

# Code
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        pairs = {
            '(': ')',
            '[': ']',
            '{': '}',
        }
        stack = deque()

        for c in s:
            if c in pairs:
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                if not stack or pairs[stack.pop()] != c:
                    return False
        return len(stack) == 0
```

# Complexity
If _n_ is the dimension of the string then:

- time: O(n)
- space: O(n)
