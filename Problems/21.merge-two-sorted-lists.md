# Problem
[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)

# Description
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists _list1_ and _list2_.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

# Constraints

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50]
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- Both _list1_ and _list2_ are sorted in non-decreasing order

# Solution
Since we want to merge the two lists in place (no new list created) we need one iterator for each list (we use the list1 and list2 themselves); at any point we check the value of list1 and list2 nodes and whichever is the smallest gets assigned to the cur.next and the iterator advances to the next node in the list. We continue until there are no nodes in one of the list and we link the remaining nodes to the tail.
To start the algorithm we use a dummy node initially empty.

# Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        head = cur = ListNode()
        # lists are non-empty
        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val < list2.val:
                cur.next = list1
                cur = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                cur.next = list2
                cur = list2
                list2 = list2.next
        
        cur.next = list1 if list1 else list2
        return head.next
```

# Complexity
If _n_ is the length of the shortest list then:

- time: O(n)
- space: O(1)
